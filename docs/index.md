This site serves as the central hub for all architecture-related documentation, including **Architectural Decision Records (ADRs)** and **C4 diagrams** for various projects. Here, you'll find detailed insights into the design, decisions, and structure of our systems.

## What You'll Find Here

**Architectural Decision Records (ADRs):**

- Explore the key decisions made during the development of our projects.
- Understand the reasoning and trade-offs behind each decision.

**C4 Diagrams:**

- Visualize the architecture of our systems using Context, Container, Component, and Code-level diagrams.
- Gain a clear understanding of how different parts of the system interact.

## How to Navigate

- Use the navigation menu to browse through the ADRs and diagrams for specific projects.
- Each project has its own section with detailed documentation.

## Why This Site?

This documentation site is designed to:

- Promote transparency in architectural decisions.
- Provide a single source of truth for system design and structure.
- Help team members and stakeholders understand the architecture at various levels of detail.
