# ADR-001: Migrate Authentication from Python to Keycloak

## Status

Proposed

## Context

The current authentication system is built using a Python service, but it's a resourcing bottleneck and hard to maintain. It also handles token validation for other services, creating unnecessary coupling and latency.

## Decision

We will migrate the authentication to Keycloak, an open-source identity and access management system, and integrate it with Spring Boot and React.

## Consequences

- Easier integration with microservices and React frontend
- Centralized user, role, and token management
- Improved maintainability and scalability
- Short-term migration effort required

## Alternatives Considered

- Rebuilding auth service in Java (more maintenance)
- Using Auth0 or Cognito (involves recurring costs)
